# Brain-Tumor-Classification
I used an efficient net model and trained it on a Brain MRI dataset. This dataset has more than 3000 Brain MRI scans which are categorized in four classes - Glioma Tumor, Meningioma Tumor, Pituitary Tumor and No Tumor. Objective of this project was to create an image classification model that can predict Brain MRI scans that
belong to one of the four classes with reasonably high accuracy (90% accuracy).
